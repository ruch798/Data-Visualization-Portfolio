## User research and interviews üéôÔ∏è
### 1. Target audience
My target audience includes **young, tech-savvy** folks who **spend hours in front of the screen**, be it playing games, working on the computer from 9-5, or constantly texting their best friend.

I aim to inform these users about the negative impact of excessive digital exposure and seek to persuade them to unplug devices and enjoy the world around them.

### 2. Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
Coming from a CS undergrad background, most of my friends or colleagues are heavy tech users. 

But to diversify the interview responses based on their usage patterns, I chose to interview: 
- a social media influencer who can never miss an update online,
- a gaming enthusiast, and 
- a programmer who is glued to the laptop for nearly the whole day. 

### 3. Interview script
**Context:**
- Do you track your social media usage?

**Audience:**
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

**Content:**
- Was the content clear to follow?

**Takeaways:**
- What was your key takeaway?
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

**Visuals:**
- Did the charts help to grasp the information presented?
- Did the visuals evoke a strong reaction?
- Were the colors chosen thoughtfully?
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

### 4. Findings from the interviews
**Similarities**
- The interviewees shared similar thoughts as me regarding the audience for this data visualization being youngsters who spend most of their time in front of screens.
- They thought the charts, visuals, and color scheme aligned well with the content theme.

**Differences**
- One of them had the same takeaway as the call-to-action. The other interviewee focused more on the data and had a new insight.

**What patterns in the feedback emerge?**
- They found the visuals interesting, which kept them engaged all throughout. The relevance of the topic to them was primal.

**What did you learn from the feedback?**
- The color scheme I chose worked well in keeping the audience intrigued.
- The images, apart from the charts, aid in engaging the audience.
- Exciting statistics in the chart can help in causing a lasting impact on the audience and can help in persuasion.
- One of the interviewees was interested in reading more about the data depicted and more call-to-action items.

### 5. Changes I plan on implementing to my visualizations to address the issues identified
**Adjusting tool-tip format**
- Currently the tool tip format is causing the text to go outside the screen area which is not ideal. I will be modifying this using Tableau.

**More narrative text**
- Since this was a draft storyboard, I hadn't added much narrative text.
However, I plan on including that in Part III with the help of my research this week.
One of my initial ideas for this is the introduction of some of my key takeaways from a research paper about nomophobia or no mobile phone phobia.

**More call-to-action items**
- I also plan to include more call-to-action items.
