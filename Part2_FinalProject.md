## User research and interviews 🎙️
### 1. Target audience
My target audience includes tech-savvy people who spend hours in front of the screen, be it playing games, working on the computer from 9-5, or constantly texting their best friend.

I aim to inform these users about the negative impact of excessive digital exposure and seek to persuade them to unplug devices and enjoy the world around them.

### 2. Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
Coming from a CS undergrad background, most of my friends or colleagues are heavy tech users. 

But to diversify the interview responses based on their usage patterns, I chose to interview: 
- a gaming enthusiast, 
- a social media influencer who can never miss an update online and 
- a programmer who is glued to the laptop for nearly the whole day
