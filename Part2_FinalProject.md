## User research and interviews 🎙️
### 1. Target audience
My target audience includes **tech-savvy** folks who **spend hours in front of the screen**, be it playing games, working on the computer from 9-5, or constantly texting their best friend.

I aim to inform these users about the negative impact of excessive digital exposure and seek to persuade them to unplug devices and enjoy the world around them.

### 2. Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
Coming from a CS undergrad background, most of my friends or colleagues are heavy tech users. 

But to diversify the interview responses based on their usage patterns, I chose to interview: 
- a social media influencer who can never miss an update online,
- a gaming enthusiast, and 
- a programmer who is glued to the laptop for nearly the whole day. 

### 3. Interview script
**Context:**
- Do you track your social media usage?

**Audience:**
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

**Content:**
- Was the content clear to follow?

**Takeaways:**
- What was your key takeaway?
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

**Visuals:**
- Did the charts help to grasp the information presented?
- Did the visuals evoke a strong reaction?
- Were the colors chosen thoughtfully?
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
