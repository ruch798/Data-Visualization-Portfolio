## About Me 👩‍💻

Hello 👋 

I'm Ruchi Bhatia, a Computer Engineering graduate pursuing my Master's degree at Carnegie Mellon University.

I'm the youngest [3x Kaggle Grandmaster](https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798) and a [Data Science Global Ambassador at Z by HP](https://www.hp.com/us-en/workstations/industries/data-science/ambassador-ruchi-bhatia.html).

</p>

Having started coding at an early age, I can say my interest in this field has only grown with time. I gravitate more towards Data Science and Data Analysis. Working in the technology sector of various MNCs like Sony and Colgate-Palmolive has helped me gain relevant experience in the industry. 

## What I hope to learn 👩‍🎓
Through this course, I aim to:
- brush up on my Data Visualization skills 
- use color theory appropriately 
- leverage tools like Tableau and Flourish to effectively engage the target audience
- develop a thoughtful narrative style for the visualizations I create

As businesses today are becoming more inextricably linked with information technology, I strive to utilize my expertise to bridge the gap between technology and business. I plan to work as a **Product Manager** in the near future where I can utilize a data-driven approach to strategize effectively!
