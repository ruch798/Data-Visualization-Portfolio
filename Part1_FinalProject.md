# Part I: Final Project

## Topic: 🏃‍♀️ Staying Healthy in the Age of Screens 
## Outline 

**High-level Summary ✍️**

Even though technology has simplified our lives and has become increasingly embedded into every aspect of our daily routines, spending too much time in front of screens can be detrimental to our physical and mental health.

**Reader's objective 📖**

As a reader, I want to understand how I can minimize screen time so that I can focus on improving my health in the long run.
I can do this by turning off my phone notifications and setting time limits for social media applications. 

**Project Structure 🪜**
- **Setup**: It's now much simpler to connect with people worldwide and exchange information and resources because of the immense power of the internet.
- **Conflict**: However, excessive screen time exacerbates mental and physical health and sometimes hurts our productivity.
- **Resolution**: Taking small steps such as setting time limits for social media applications to minimize screen time daily can improve one's health in the long run.

**Story Arc 📜** 

Sections I'd like to highlight during my presentation:
**Setup:**
- Technology exposes us to a lot of data daily. 
- People spend roughly one-half of their waking hours (44%) staring at a screen.

**Conflict:**
- Increases chances of obesity, vision problems, and insomnia.
- Social media comparison might hurt your self-esteem.
- Reduces productivity.
- Prone to developing addictive patterns.

**Resolution:**
- Recommendations to minimize screen time and lead a healthy lifestyle.

## Method and Medium ⚙️ 
I will be using the following tools for implementing my project:
- **Shorthand**: for developing my story narrative and delivering it effectively
- **Tableau** and **Flourish**: for creating data visualizations that are interactive
- **Canva**: for creating custom visuals that support my story arc

I intend to include accompanying graphics, such as reference charts, to help the audience understand the charts' takeaway faster.
