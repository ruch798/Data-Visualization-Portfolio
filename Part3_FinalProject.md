# Part III: Final Project
## Summary

[Data Story Shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/staying-healthy-in-the-age-of-screens/index.html)

### Part I

I started the project by highlighting the high-level summary, identifying the reader's objective, and laying down the project structure in terms of setup, conflict, and resolution.

After this, I created the story arc for my presentation and sketched the ebbs and flows of how I want to drive the audience's emotions.  

Next, I prepared initial sketches based on the story's main elements.

I identified the tools I would use for creating various storyboard elements like Shorthand for presenting, Tableau for visualizations, and Canva for creating custom visuals. 

I wrapped up Part I by specifying the call-to-action items.

The in-class peer feedback helped me identify elements I could improve in Part II.

### Part II

I created the visualizations in Tableau and laid out the initial storyboard draft in Shorthand. 

I also created a mood board to visualize whether the pictures I picked and the color scheme were in sync with the overall mood of the topic delivery.

After identifying the target audience, I also created a script for conducting user research. The interviewees were chosen to accommodate as much diversity as possible. 

Questions were centered around: 

- Context: whether they track their social media usage

- Audience: who would be the general audience in their opinion

- Content: effectiveness of content delivery

- Key Takeaways: whether they find anything surprising or confusing

- Visuals: whether the charts help to grasp the information presented

In-class peer feedback for this section helped identify several key points I would like to accommodate in Part III to help the audience understand the storyflow more effectively. 

### Part III

For the final deliverable, I focused on accommodating feedback from the Course Professor, Teaching Assistant, interviewees, and my classmates. 

The changes I made were centered around the following:

- Modifying the Tableau visualizations to stitch well with the format on Shorthand.

- Shuffling the story layout to make the storyflow more logical.

- Re-aligning and adding chart elements to make them more readable.
