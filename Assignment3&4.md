# Assignment 3 and 4
## Step one: find a data visualization (with data you can use!)

As a Computer Engineer, it is imperative to be updated about advancements in the industry, especially when there are new strides daily. 

### 🗓️ 2020 - When I first saw the chart

I remember coming across a visualization about the biggest tech acquisitions in 2020, which was extremely hard to infer when I first glanced at it. 

### 🗓️ 2022 - Reviewing it from a critic's perspective

With the knowledge I have about critiquing visualizations through this course, I could see a lot of reasons why the chart was challenging to interpret and misleading in several ways.

**Data visualization and source:** 
- Visual Capitalist published this data visualization in an article called [Visualizing the Biggest Tech Mergers and Acquisitions of 2020](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-biggest-tech-mergers-and-acquisitions-of-2020/).
- The **original data source** for this visualization was an [article published by Computer World](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3513439/biggest-technology-acquisitions-of-2020.html).
