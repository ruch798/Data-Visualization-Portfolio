# Assignment 3 and 4
## Step one: find a data visualization (with data you can use!)

As a Computer Engineer, it is imperative to be updated about advancements in the industry, especially when there are new strides daily. 

### üóìÔ∏è 2020 - When I first saw the chart

I remember coming across a visualization about the biggest tech acquisitions in 2020, which was extremely hard to infer when I first glanced at it. 

### üóìÔ∏è 2022 - Reviewing it from a critic's perspective

With the knowledge I have about critiquing visualizations through this course, I could see a lot of reasons why the chart was challenging to interpret and misleading in several ways.

- **Data Visualization** : Visual Capitalist, [Visualizing the Biggest Tech Mergers and Acquisitions of 2020](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-biggest-tech-mergers-and-acquisitions-of-2020/).
- **Original data source** : Computer World, [Biggest technology acquisitions of 2020](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3513439/biggest-technology-acquisitions-of-2020.html).

## Step two: critique the data visualization
## Informative üìö
### Usefulness 
Is it useful for the intended audience?  Does it communicate valuable information?

### Completeness  
Does the visualization have everything necessary to make it understandable?

### Perceptibility
Can the reader understand the information with minimal effort? Is the visualization type appropriate?  Does it use illogical comparisons?

### Truthfulness
Is the visualization accurate, reliable and valid?  Is it representing what it says it is, and in the most complete and truthful manner? Does it misrepresent the data or make comparisions that aren't correct?

### Intuitiveness
Is it easy to understand and clearly communicates the information?  If unfamiliar, does it include easy to understand instructions on how to interpret it?

## Emotive ü§©
### Aesthetics
It is interesting / enjoyable to look at?  Is it a good example of what a beautiful data visualization might look like?  Is it somewhere in the middle - pleasing but otherwise not distracting to look at?

### Engagement
Does it lead the audience to learn more about the topic?  Does it inspire the audience to talk about the data or share it with others?
