# Assignment 3 and 4
## Step one: find a data visualization (with data you can use!)

As a Computer Engineer, it is imperative to be updated about advancements in the industry, especially when there are new strides daily. 

### üóìÔ∏è 2020 - When I first saw the chart

I remember coming across a visualization about the biggest tech acquisitions in 2020, which was extremely hard to infer when I first glanced at it. 

### üóìÔ∏è 2022 - Reviewing it from a critic's perspective

With the knowledge I have about critiquing visualizations through this course, I could see a lot of reasons why the chart was challenging to interpret and misleading in several ways.

- **Data Visualization** : Visual Capitalist, [Visualizing the Biggest Tech Mergers and Acquisitions of 2020](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-biggest-tech-mergers-and-acquisitions-of-2020/).
- **Original data source** : Computer World, [Biggest technology acquisitions of 2020](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3513439/biggest-technology-acquisitions-of-2020.html).

## Step two: critique the data visualization
## Informative üìö
### Usefulness 
Is it useful for the intended audience?  Does it communicate valuable information?
<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Sc8Maxu.png" width=700></p>
The visualization communicates useful information for a tech audience interested in learning more about **mergers and acquisistions during the pandemic**.

### Completeness  
Does the visualization have everything necessary to make it understandable?
<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/A5etdsn.png" width=700></p>
The **timeline** at the bottom of the chart helps us to infer that most companies saw the opportunity to grow their business through mergers and acquisitions when the market was down.

### Perceptibility
Can the reader understand the information with minimal effort? Is the visualization type appropriate?  Does it use illogical comparisons?
<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2giiCsa.png" width=700></p>
**Design**
- The selected graph type is **unconventional**, which shifts the focus from the information being conveyed to the user admiring the design component of the visualization.
- **Colors have been unnecessarily used** to compare the intensities of each data point when the length of bars could have sufficed.

**Information**
- The information is **difficult for the human eye to perceive** with minimal effort and appropriate precision. 
- The **scale chosen is inaccurate** as well. For example, $40B is not 40 times $1B in the chart. 

### Truthfulness
Is the visualization accurate, reliable and valid?  Is it representing what it says it is, and in the most complete and truthful manner? Does it misrepresent the data or make comparisions that aren't correct?
<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ckgre4Y.png" width=700></p>
- The visualization is inaccurate, unreliable, and invalid. 
- The **comparisons drawn** in the chart are **not correct**. For example, $40B is not 40 times $1B in the chart.

### Intuitiveness
Is it easy to understand and clearly communicates the information?  If unfamiliar, does it include easy to understand instructions on how to interpret it?
<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PviSGNF.png" width=700></p>
- The chosen chart type is **unconventional** in the tech industry.¬†
- Although instructions on interpreting the chart have been provided, the **depiction of each data point** is **inaccurate** because of the shape chosen instead of a bar.¬†
- **No visual scale** has been provided for accurate comparison.
- For smaller M&A, the **text size** is **difficult to read**.
- The convention specified in the instructions mentioned that the company names inside the bubble-shaped bar were the acquired companies. But in the case of more minor mergers and acquisitions, the shape was too small to accommodate¬†the company names, so the **visualization broke the instructions it had set** to convey the information, which makes it **inconsistent**.¬†

## Emotive ü§©
### Aesthetics
It is interesting / enjoyable to look at?  Is it a good example of what a beautiful data visualization might look like?  Is it somewhere in the middle - pleasing but otherwise not distracting to look at?
<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6vCa7yX.png" width=700></p>
The data visualization is interesting but confusing to interpret.

### Engagement
Does it lead the audience to learn more about the topic?  Does it inspire the audience to talk about the data or share it with others?
<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/npAl40h.png" width=700></p>
- The visualization packs a lot of information, but it would lead the tech audience to learn more about the topic. 
- It inspires the audience to share it with more people in their network.

### Overall observations
What stood out to you?  What did you find worked really well?  What didn't?  What, if anything, would you do differently?  

### Audience 
Who is the primary audience for this tool?  Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience?  Why or why not?

### Final thoughts
How successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here?  What would you change?  Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.)
